        You are a resume optimization expert. Your task is to determine which blocks to include in a one-page resume.
        
        MUST INCLUDE BLOCKS (non-negotiable):
        [
  {
    "block_id": "block_3",
    "description": "work experience: ",
    "type": "work experience"
  },
  {
    "block_id": "block_4",
    "description": "work experience: ",
    "type": "work experience"
  },
  {
    "block_id": "block_6",
    "description": "Publication: Retrieval-Augmented Conversational Recommendation with Prompt-Based Semi-Structured Natural Language State Tracking",
    "type": "publication"
  }
]
        
        RANKED BLOCKS (in order of importance):
        [
  {
    "block_id": "block_5",
    "rank": 1,
    "description": "Experience: Voith Hydro - Software Engineer Intern",
    "type": "work experience"
  },
  {
    "block_id": "block_7",
    "rank": 2,
    "description": "Publication: Elaborative Subtopic Query Reformulation for Query-Driven Recommendation",
    "type": "publication"
  },
  {
    "block_id": "block_8",
    "rank": 3,
    "description": "Project: Subjective Summarization with PCA + LLM",
    "type": "project"
  },
  {
    "block_id": "block_9",
    "rank": 4,
    "description": "Project: Geometric Approach to Query Performance Prediction",
    "type": "project"
  },
  {
    "block_id": "block_10",
    "rank": 5,
    "description": "Project: LLM Powered Resume Modifier for Job Descriptions",
    "type": "project"
  },
  {
    "block_id": "block_11",
    "rank": 6,
    "description": "awards: ",
    "type": "awards"
  }
]
        
        GUIDELINES:
        - A one-page resume typically has limited space
        - Experience sections usually take 6-8 lines each
        - Project sections usually take 3-4 lines each
        - Publication sections usually take 2-3 lines each
        - Education and skills sections (not in the ranked list) will also occupy space
        - The goal is to include as many relevant blocks as possible while keeping to one page
        
        Determine a rank threshold (1-6) from the ranked list. All blocks with rank less than or equal to this threshold should be included.
        
        Return ONLY the rank as a number, nothing else.

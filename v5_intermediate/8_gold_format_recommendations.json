  "original_response": "Based on the analysis, the resume is currently too long (2 pages) and needs to be condensed to a single page. Following the instructions and context:\n\nHere are 3 specific changes to make the resume fit exactly on one page while maintaining a professional appearance:\n\n1.  **Remove the \"Projects\" section:** As identified in the context, `block_9` is the least important block included. The \"Projects\" section is typically the most suitable candidate for removal when space is limited, after core sections like Education and Experience. Removing this entire section will free up significant space.\n2.  **Reduce margins:** Slightly decrease the top/bottom and left/right margins (e.g., from 1 inch or 0.75 inches to 0.5 inches). This is a common and effective way to gain space without significantly altering the appearance.\n3.  **Slightly reduce font size:** Reduce the main body font size by a small increment (e.g., from 11pt to 10.5pt, or 10.5pt to 10pt if needed). This small change can save several lines of space across the document, helping to fit remaining content after removing the Projects section and adjusting margins.",

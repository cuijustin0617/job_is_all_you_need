        You are a resume optimization expert. Your task is to determine which blocks to include in a one-page resume.
        
        MUST INCLUDE BLOCKS (non-negotiable):
        [
  "block_2",
  "block_3"
]
        
        RANKED BLOCKS (in order of importance):
        []
        
        GUIDELINES:
        - A one-page resume typically has limited space
        - Experience sections usually take 6-8 lines each
        - Project sections usually take 3-4 lines each
        - Publication sections usually take 2-3 lines each
        - Education and skills sections (not in the ranked list) will also occupy space
        - The goal is to include as many relevant blocks as possible while keeping to one page
        
        Determine a rank threshold (1-0) from the ranked list. All blocks with rank less than or equal to this threshold should be included.
        
        Return ONLY the rank as a number, nothing else.
